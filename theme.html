	<h1> FAST AND FURIOUS 7<br>
			(THEME)</h1>
	<img src="theme.jpg"><br><br>
	<p>Morgan and the cast continue to build the central honorable "family"
	theme that ties these characters from all backgrounds and walks of life together.  That's where the real strength of this 
	franchise comes from.  In this film, that core comes from Paul Walker.  His Brian O'Conner is a distant Robin to Vin Diesel's Batman, but his character's development from a punk FBI agent to a stoic father is the heartbeat underneath all of the toughness.  <br> <br>

	Despite each entry out-grossing the previous one since 2009, put me in the camp of people that wished and hoped that Universal Pictures wasn't going to milk this franchise further after Walker's untimely and tragic death.  I know the post-credits scene of "Fast and Furious 6" intentionally set the stage for this promised seventh film, but it didn't seem right after losing Paul.  Sure, we wouldn't have gotten Jason Statham and Kurt Russell but "Fast and Furious 6" gave you that parting shot and happy ending of the "family" back in L.A. where it all started eating barbecue and tipping back Coronas in the Toretto backyard.  If that ended up being the last we saw of this cast and franchise, that would have been enough and completely understandable. <br>
